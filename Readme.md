# React Linked List Visual
This is a simple linked list visual project with the help of ReactJs as they provide a lot of flexibility with DOM so I used it. You can also build this project in simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but will take more time to manipulate the dom.

## Run
    git clone <repo_link>
    npm install
    npm start

## Note
Make your learning happy with these types of projects, because they give you some funny exposure to how the real word thing makes it easy to understand with some funny stuff.
